## Notes

I wasn't able to actually create a permalink.
I am suspecting it was due to the fact that PS didn't have the permission to create a cache folder in my Windows OS root directory.  
The work around for the above situation was to install WPSeed packet with npm, nodejs and gulp.  
For some reason some xss commands do not work, but others did which worked out.
